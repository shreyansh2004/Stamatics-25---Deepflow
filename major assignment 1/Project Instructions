Project Instructions

● Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the sale price of bulldozers and other heavy equipment at auction.
This model will help Fast Iron create a reliable “Blue Book” pricing guide for customers based on:
Usage


Equipment type


Configuration


● What You Need to Do
→ Phase 1: Understand the Data
Read and explore the training dataset.


Use the Data Dictionary.xlsx to understand each feature.


Identify:


Missing values


Incorrect or unusual data types


Outliers


    → Phase 2: Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handle missing values appropriately.


Correct data types and drop irrelevant columns.


Convert categorical variables using encoding techniques (e.g., one-hot, label encoding).


Extract useful features (e.g., from the sale date).
→ Phase 3: Model Building
Train a regression model using the cleaned training data.


Try different algorithms and compare their performance.


Use validation data to evaluate model performance.


→ Phase 4: Make Predictions
Apply your final model to the test data (Test data file).


Generate a prediction file named test_predictions in this format:

 SalesID, SalePrice  
1222837, 36205  
3044012, 74570  
1222841, 31910.50  

Deliverable: Submit a correctly formatted prediction file.
● Evaluation Metric
Your predictions will be evaluated using RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error).


RMSLE penalises large errors, especially underestimating high prices.



● Final Submission Checklist
Ensure your final submission includes:
 ▪ A well-documented Google Colab notebook (.ipynb)
 ▪ A correctly formatted prediction file
 ▪ A short README or summary describing your approach
 ▪ All files uploaded to GitHub
 ▪ Share your GitHub repo link when requested
