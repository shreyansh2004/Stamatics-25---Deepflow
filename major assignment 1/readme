Execution Plan for ConnectHire Platform
1. Objective Understanding
Build a full-stack platform connecting developers with companies for hiring in full-time, freelance, and internship capacities.


Ensure seamless workflows for both user types, real-time updates, and scalable architecture.



2. User Roles and Core Flows
Developer:
Sign up, create a profile, upload resume


Showcase skills, certifications, and projects


Search and apply for jobs


Track application status, receive real-time updates


Chat with recruiters, attend scheduled interviews


Company:
Register, create a company profile


Post job listings with filters


Search for candidates using advanced filters


View developer profiles, initiate contact or schedule interviews


Manage applicants and hiring status



3. Project Phases
Phase 1 – Core Platform (MVP):
User Authentication (JWT + bcrypt)


Developer and Company Dashboards


Profile Management and Resume Upload (via AWS S3)


Job Posting and Filtering System


Application Tracking


Real-Time Notifications (Socket.IO or Redis Pub/Sub)


Phase 2 – Extended Features:
Real-time messaging


Interview scheduling


Payment Integration for premium job listings


Ratings and reviews


Admin panel for platform oversight


Mobile responsiveness and multi-language support



4. Tech Stack
Frontend:
React.js with Redux and React Router


Axios for API communication


Tailwind CSS or custom utility classes for responsiveness


Backend:
Node.js with Express.js


MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling


Redis (optional) for Pub/Sub and caching


AWS S3 for file uploads


JWT for secure authentication


DevOps & Tools:
Git & GitHub for version control


Docker for local development


Render or Railway for deployment


Postman for API testing


ESLint + Prettier for code consistency



5. Database Design (MongoDB Collections)
Users: Common auth fields, role (developer or company)


Developers: Profile info, skills, resume URL, applied jobs


Companies: Company details, posted jobs


Jobs: Job details, tags, location, status, applicants


Messages: Chat content, sender and receiver


Notifications: Type, user, reference IDs, timestamps


Reviews: Company ↔ Developer ratings



6. Authentication and Security
JWT tokens for protected routes


Bcrypt for password hashing


Role-based access controls


Input validation and sanitization


File upload restrictions (size/type checks)


CORS, rate limiting, and error handling



7. Real-Time Features
Use Socket.IO or Redis Pub/Sub to push:


New application alerts


Interview scheduling updates


Chat messages


Job posting status updates



8. Resume and Document Uploads
Use AWS S3 for cloud storage


Use signed URLs to securely upload documents


Store URLs in developer profiles for retrieval and preview



9. Testing and Validation
Manual flow testing for all user journeys


API validation using Postman


Basic unit tests for critical backend logic


Test edge cases (e.g., empty fields, invalid uploads, expired tokens)



10. Deployment Strategy
Frontend on Vercel with CI from GitHub


Backend on Render or Railway


MongoDB Atlas as the managed database


AWS S3 for persistent file storage


.env configuration for all secrets and keys
